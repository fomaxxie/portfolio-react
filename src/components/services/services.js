          <p>A couple of years now I have been looking to change my career
            and follow my passion in tech. This started out by teaching myself
            Python which was shortly followed by PostgreSQL. At my previous job
            I was excited to be able to utilize my abilities for the first time,
            soon I was building complex queries that finally allowed the company
            to visualize their data. That was it, I was hooked. After that I saw
            that I wanted to pursue this path full time. A couple of months later
            I enrolled in the 10 week full-stack developer bootcamp from Le Wagon.
            There I learned a plethora of languages and tools including HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript ES6, Ruby & Ruby on Rails (including the MVC-Framework),
            SQL, git & GitHub, Heroku and much more.</p>
